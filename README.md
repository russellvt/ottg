# Obey the Testing Goat
Another new walk-through (for me) of [Test Driven Development with
Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_01.html).

There is a [Github Repo](https://github.com/hjwp/book-example), but this
will be from scratch, and may have provisions for my own development
environments (mostly Vim, Pyenv, and/or PyCharm).


## My Environment
Note that I am intending to use both `Mercurial` and `github` for this
run-through... mostly because I tend to enjoy pain. I also tend to use
`vim` with things like `pylint` and `pyflakes` attached to it - so things
may be a little chaotic at times to clean-up "lazy" code.
